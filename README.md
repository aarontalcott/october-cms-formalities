# Formalities - 1.0.0-alpha

A plugin to help you embed [October CMS](https://octobercms.com) [back-end forms](https://octobercms.com/docs/backend/forms) in your front-end theme.

## Description

This plugin addresses the use case in which plugin model instances must be created and saved using a form on the publicly-available front end of a site but accessible to administrative users in the back end control panel. For instance, you want site users to be able to submit contact form submissions and have them available in list and detail views to admin users in the back end.

## Installation

Copy the `leapfrog` directory into your plugins directory.

## Usage

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/aarontalcott/october-cms-formalities/wiki/) for documentation.
